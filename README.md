Exploring the [linregress](https://crates.io/crates/linregress)

in the future sich as [ndarray-linalg](https://crates.io/crates/ndarray-linalg)

ATM, bard.google.com couldn't get anything to compile, see
this [conversation](https://g.co/bard/share/3bace7d202c5).

ChatGPT-4 was able to get gpt4-1.rs to compile after 7 tries and then
one additional tweak was needed to get it to run. Add another data point.
